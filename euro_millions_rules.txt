(A) Introduction to EuroMillions and UK Millionaire Maker

(1) EuroMillions is a separate game in each participating country, but prizes are pooled and shared between all winning players using the results of a shared EuroMillions Draw. This is explained in more detail below.
(2) UK Millionaire Maker is only available to play in the UK and Isle of Man. Camelot can withdraw the UK Millionaire Maker game at any time by giving at least four weeks’ notice.
(3) EuroMillions costs £1.65 to play and UK Millionaire Maker costs 85 pence to play. However, as entry into UK Millionaire Maker is automatic when You play EuroMillions and the Games cannot be played separately, the total cost of playing is £2.50.
(4) Draws for both Games take place on Tuesdays and Fridays, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

(B) Playing EuroMillions and UK Millionaire Maker online

(1) To play EuroMillions on the Site, You should fill in the interactive play slip for EuroMillions by following the instructions provided. To buy EuroMillions Entries with Your Pingit Account, You should follow the instructions provided.
(2) A ‘week’, when mentioned in the number of weeks section, will start on the first available Tuesday or Friday Draw day that Your Entry is entered into and will end immediately before (and excluding) the Draws on the same day of the following calendar week.
(3) For each EuroMillions Entry, You will be given a unique UK Millionaire Maker code made up of four letters and five numbers generated by Camelot’s Computer System – this will be Your UK Millionaire Maker Entry.
(4) Your UK Millionaire Maker Entry will automatically be entered into the UK Millionaire Maker Draw taking place on the same day as the EuroMillions Draw You have entered.
(5) If You buy a Multi-Draw EuroMillions Entry, the same UK Millionaire Maker code will be entered into all UK Millionaire Maker Draws that Your Multi-Draw EuroMillions Entry is valid for. As Camelot’s automatic draw machine selects a winning UK Millionaire Maker Entry at random from all valid UK Millionaire Maker Entries, each UK Millionaire Maker Entry has an equal chance of winning, regardless of whether it was bought on the day of the UK Millionaire Maker Draw or a number of weeks in advance.
(6) If You are playing EuroMillions by Direct Debit, You will get a different UK Millionaire Maker Entry for each Millionaire Maker Draw.
(7) If You have used Your Account to buy a EuroMillions Entry and Your Selection is not shown in Your “My account” section of the Site, then that Selection will not have been entered into any EuroMillions Draw and You will not have been issued with a UK Millionaire Maker Entry for that Selection.
(8) If You have used Your Pingit Account to buy a EuroMillions Entry, You should be able to view Your Entries by following the link shown in Your Pingit Account after You have made Your purchase, or in the email confirmation sent to You by Camelot. If You can’t see the link or do not receive an email, and are not sure if Your purchase was successful or what Your Entries are, You should contact the Customer Care Team.
(9) It is possible to win a Prize and a UK Millionaire Maker Prize with one Entry.
