Lottery analysis program

TODO
Add feedback that allows learning of patterns. 
 - Score for each line on each ticket.  The higher the better. 
 - Compare scores against methods.
Create more analysis tools to improve ticket generation.
 - Things to try:
   - Look at short term (less than n) results to pick up "hot" numbers.
   - Look at longer term (more than n) results for numbers that haven't come up 
     in a long time.
   - Look at winning results and look for patterns in previous draws.
